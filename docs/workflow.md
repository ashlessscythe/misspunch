Workflow Overview

    Payroll Entry: Payroll staff enters data for each compensable time record, including employee details, date, times (IN, OUT, MEAL IN, MEAL OUT), and reasons for any missed punches.
    Supervisor Review: The supervisor reviews the data and confirms accuracy.
    Associate Confirmation: The supervisor presents the completed form to the associate on a touchscreen device.
        The associate can sign with their finger to confirm.
        Alternatively, the associate can request a printout.
    Record Submission:
        If signed electronically, the record is saved digitally.
        If a printout is signed, it can be scanned and uploaded to the system.
