| IN                      | Time       |
| OUT                     | Time       |
| MEAL IN                 | Time       |
| MEAL OUT                | Time       |
| Reason for Missed Punch | Dropdown   |
| Other (please explain)  | Text       |

| Amount                  | Text       |

### Notes:

- **Reason for Missed Punch**: This can be a dropdown with options like _Forgot time card_, _Lost time card_, _Forgot to punch_, _In the Field (no clock)_, and _Other_.
- **Employee Signature**: This could be an area for digital signing, but if kept simple, it’s a regular text input for typing a name.
