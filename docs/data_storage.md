Data Storage and Security

    Database Requirements:
        Store each record's fields, including timestamps and reasons for missed punches.
        Store digital signatures securely as part of the record.
        Track records of edits or deletions (audit log) for payroll compliance.
    File Uploads:
        If printed records are scanned and uploaded, these files should be stored with the corresponding record ID.
    Security:
        Ensure compliance with data protection regulations (e.g., restrict access to authorized personnel).
        Encrypt sensitive information, including signatures.
